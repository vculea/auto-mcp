Automation with playwright with mcp

# Conclusions:

## Pros:
- For test generation
- To help you fix tests
- Testing with prompts, only for those who don't care about predictability and have money to throw at AIs
- Prompts written with concrete steps, works so-so

## Cons: 
- Prompts in a simple application, and even then it doesn't do everything it should
- You depend on AI and it consumes many tokens
- Prompts need complex instructions to make, because you need to know Playwright very well and no one guarantees that the AI will read the instructions all the time
- Human intervention is required, and often it confuses you more than helps you
